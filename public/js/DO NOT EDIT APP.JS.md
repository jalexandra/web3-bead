# IMPORTANT
> DO NOT EDIT app.js directly. This file will be generated from your module files when you run `yarn run development`. Then include app.js with `<script src="{{ mix('app.js') }}"></script>`
> 
> However you can create simple js files here and load them from your views with `script src="{{ asset('my.js') }}"></script>`.
