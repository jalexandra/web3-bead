# IMPORTANT
> DO NOT EDIT app.css directly. This file will be generated from your sass or scss files when you run `yarn run development`. Then include app.css with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ mix(app.css) }}">`
> 
> However you can create simple css files here and load them from your views with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/my.css') }}">`.
